    <h2>I'm Vikram, a product designer and systems thinker.</h2>
    <p>
      Working from problem definition through to usability testing, I design
      software that make developers more productive. I also implement design
      systems and grow design operations. Currently, I work remotely for LaunchDarkly from
      Colorado.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before working in product, I was a high school technology teacher and Drupal
      developer. And way before that I was just a kid prototyping apps in Visual
      Basic and making flyers in Photoshop on an x86. I'm not actively looking for work
      but I'd love to hear what you're working on. Email me, atavikram at gmail
      dot com.
    </p>
    <h3>LaunchDarkly</h3>
    <p>
      I currently work at LaunchDarkly as a design lead in their Core Application
      squad. Our team is tasked with improving understanding and
      adoption of feature management, and how to effectively serve billions of flags daily to enterprise
      and commercial customers. As part of that work, we're reworking our information architecture to
      support better navigation, data displays and rollout configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to this, I was responsible for building a design system across Figma
      and Storybook during the course of feature development. Adding to this
      operational work, I've developed other standards such as designs
      briefs, interface inspections, whiteboarding and story mapping sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My most recent project involved migrating our documentation site to a
      modern development stack. Central to this process was defining and
      prototyping a design system in React in parallel with Figma.
    </p>
    <h3>Gigster</h3>
    <p>
      In my time at Gigster, I worked on a variety of projects from design
      systems to marketing. Most notably, I worked on producing a Sketch and
      Figma component library for gig Designers. I was responsible for research,
      implementation and product marketing of the tool. Post launch we saw an
      increase in consistency alongside quicker developer implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My final project at Gigster involved redesigning and migrating our blog.
      The old site was bogged down by a poor implementation and performance. Our
      CSS implementation improved from a 500kb bundle, 10k declarations and 300
      fonts sizes to just 50kb, 800 declarations and 20 font sizes.

      Vikram is intelligent and self-motivated, driven to work to the best of
      his ability. He pursued continuous improvement staying informed about the
      latest design trends and showing interest in the strategic direction of
      the company. He moderates project discussions collaboratively, pulling
      together multiple stakeholders, and prioritizing necessary actions. His
      ability to work closely with engineers allowed us to ship a new blog
      faster and more efficiently compared to similar previous projects. â€”Alonzo
      Felix, Design Director at Gigster
