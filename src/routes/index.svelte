      I'm Vikram, a product designer, systems thinker and problem solver. I like
      to work on things that makes customers and teams more productive. In other
      words, I implement design systems, grow design operations, and lead
      product discovery. I live in Colorado and work remotely as a Product
      Designer at LaunchDarkly.
    </p>
    <h3>LaunchDarkly</h3>
    <p>
      I currently work at LaunchDarkly as a design lead for their Application
      Workflows team. Our team is tasked with improving understanding and
      adoption of core features. We serve billions of flags daily to enterprise
      and commercial customers. Our team is reworking the information
      architecture to support better navigation, data displays and
      configuration. Our initial work has seen higher engagement from new user
      segments and reduced workflow effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to this, I was responsible for building a design system across Figma
      and Storybook during the course of feature development. Adding to this
      operational work, I've developed other standards such as designs
      specifications and collaborative user-interface reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      My most recent project involved migrating our documentation site to a
      modern development stack. Central to this process was defining and
      prototyping a design system in React in parallel with Figma.
    </p>
    <h3>Gigster</h3>
    <p>
      In my time at Gigster, I worked on a variety of projects from design
      systems to marketing. Most notably, I worked on producing a Sketch and
      Figma component library for gig Designers. I was responsible for research,
      implementation and product marketing of the tool. Post launch we saw an
      increase in consistency alongside quicker developer implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My final project at Gigster involved redesigning and migrating our blog.
      The old site was bogged down by a poor implementation and performance. Our
      CSS implementation improved from a 500kb bundle, 10k declarations and 300
      fonts sizes to just 50kb, 800 declarations and 20 font sizes.

      Vikram is intelligent and self-motivated, driven to work to the best of
      his ability. He pursued continuous improvement staying informed about the
      latest design trends and showing interest in the strategic direction of
      the company. He moderates project discussions collaboratively, pulling
      together multiple stakeholders, and prioritizing necessary actions. His
      ability to work closely with engineers allowed us to ship a new blog
      faster and more efficiently compared to similar previous projects. â€”Alonzo
      Felix, Design Director at Gigster
